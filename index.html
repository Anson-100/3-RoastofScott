    <h3>Scott likes to roast people every chance he gets. He roasts me, he roasts you, and he roasts everybody else, too. Even though you know ahead of time Scott is gonna roast your ass, it is very hard to prepare for it since he is so well-versed in psychological warfare and comes up with most of his material on the spot. In all fairness, he does not discriminate when it comes to roasting motherfuckers and that has to be respected.  </h3>
